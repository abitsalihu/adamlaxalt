            My name is <span class="laxalt_title--red"> Adam Laxalt</span>. I
            come from Reno city and was born on 31 August 1978. I am running for
            Congress in our beloved state of Nevada as a Republican Party
            candidate. I am thrilled to be here today and have the opportunity
            to introduce myself to you and share my vision of this great Silver
            State.
          </span>

          <span>
            After 9/11 I felt more than ever that my duty was to fight for my
            country. I have been defending my country from overseas as a Navy
            and enforcing the law as an Attorney General. I have received
            numerous medals for fighting in Iraq. Although, no medal can compare
            to the pride of being able to defend my country. No medal could
            describe the pain of having our fellow Americans lost to enemies.
            There always has been good and evil in this world and I have always
            chosen to fight for the good. I have served on the side of my people
            as an attorney as well - protecting the state’s most vulnerable
            citizens, keeping its communities safe, and pursuing justice for
            victims of sexual assault. I’ve committed my life to fight for
            what’s right because that’s what Americans do. Now the time has come
            for me to serve my country as a Senator of Nevada. Now the time has
            come to pick sides!
          </span>

          <span>
            I am a firm believer that God has given everyone a right to life,
            liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. I support the right of
            citizens to defend their families and kids if the necessity will be.
            Nobody can take the right of defending our sons and daughters,
            mother and fathers, wives and husbands. Nobody can take this from us
            - Americans. Our ancestors and fellow veterans have been doing this
            and we will do this too. This is essential to the maintenance of a
            free society and a right I will defend vigorously as your Senator.
          </span>

          <span>
            I believe building a stronger and more prosperous Nevada depends
            first and foremost on the safety of our communities. As a Senator, I
            will continue to work tirelessly to protect our state, I will always
            promote policies that protect the citizens of Nevada from dangerous
            criminals. I will strongly support our local law enforcement against
            efforts to make Nevada a sanctuary state. Some people have been
            trying to do this and I will never let this happen!
          </span>

          <span>
            I am committed to strengthening our economy and believe that Nevada
            can take greater steps than it has ever taken. People will agree
            that we are entering a new era of tremendous prosperity. The
            opportunity is in front of us if we take a forward-thinking approach
            to developing our economy. My predecessors from other parties have
            been using their power in the favor of themselves and their
            supporters. I guarantee that I can bring economic change to Nevada
            and remove barriers to job creation for everyone.
          </span>

          <span>
            Young people are the future of our nation. If we don’t support them
            there is no development or progress. Education is the key to our
            success! For the sake of young Nevadans, it will be my top priority
            to ensure that no child gets left behind the school doors. We owe
            this to our children and grandchildren!
          </span>

          <span>
            My Plan for a better Nevada outlines a vision of opportunity, social
            justice, and prosperity for all. My goal to modernize and expand
            public infrastructure will be beneficial so people can go to work
            with better buses and on better roads. I will remove the quotas on
            the environmental resources as well. Nature gives us the power to
            make gas prices cheaper and leftists are just saying no to it.
            Capturing the development of a flourishing economy will influence
            every ordinary life - we will create more jobs for our people, and
            make food prices cheaper and available for everyone. I promise to
            never say no to the wellness of our people!
          </span>

          <span>
            If you think that I am your candidate, support me and the Republican
            Party and vote for our candidates on the day of the elections.
            Together we can continue to make America great! Thank you for your
            time, thank you, everyone!
          </span>
          <span>
            God bless you and God bless <span class="america"> America!</span>
